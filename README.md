## Performance Notes & Next Steps

The site is optimized for quick loading on mobile (preloaded hero image, lazy-loading images, reduced effects on small screens). Suggested next improvements:

- Provide optimized image assets (WebP/AVIF) and `srcset` for responsive images.
- Inline critical CSS for the hero area to improve First Paint.
- Add a lightweight service worker to cache assets for repeat visits.

If you'd like, I can prepare optimized images and `srcset` markup, or add a small service worker for caching.
